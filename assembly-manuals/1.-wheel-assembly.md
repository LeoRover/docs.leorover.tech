### Step 2: Bearings

Prepare:

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010952.JPG)

Put the rear bearing on the tube. It may be tight - just slide it gently and even on the pre-greased tube.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the bearing jams on the tube, don't push it too hard. Try to take it back, grease the bearing and slide again. If it still doesn't help, tackle the bearing evenly around its circumference.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010986.JPG)

Push the tube assembly in the wheel rim. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mind there may be some 3d-print imperfections in the rim to be tackled before you push the assembly. Take a look at the rim and notice if there are any bumps or filament leftovers - cut them if needed,
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010988.JPG)

Push all the way to meet the front bearing. There should be no gap between the bearing and the rim front lip.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010990.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010994.JPG)

Use the wheel hub as a tool during the assembly.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010995.JPG)

Put the hub all the way on the motor shaft \(don't worry about any positioning this time\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010996.JPG)

Place the whole wheel on the motor hub.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010999.JPG)

Locate the rim tightening slot.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020002.JPG)

Assemble the m3x12 and fi3 washer and m3 square nut together. Don't tighten them, just put together.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020005.JPG)

Put the screw assembly in the tightening slot. Tighten the screw with the nut. Use no. 2,5 key for the screw and your fingers to secure the nut. Make sure the screw doesn't come out of the slot.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020008.JPG)

Take the wheel hub off.

{% hint style="danger" %}
MindL if you don't use the glue here your Rover will end up untightening the wheels every 15-20 minutes of work. Make sure you use a proper glue here.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020029.JPG)

Put the screw in a corresponding hole in the wheel hub. Don't tighten.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020031.JPG)

Open your lithium grease.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020037.JPG)

Put grease everywhere between the wheel tube and simmering. It will act both as greasing agent and as a sealant.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020039.JPG)

Put the wheel hub on the motor shaft.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020042.JPG)

Leave ca. 1 mm gap between the wheel tube and wheel hub.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you line the torque plate holes with wheel hub threaded holes.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020053.JPG)

Tighten 3x m4x8 round head screws on the torque plate. Tighten them as shown in the photo.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020057.JPG)

Tighten the rest of round head screws.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020058.JPG)

### Step 8: Motor cap

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020064.JPG)

Put the inserts in corresponding slots in the wheel cap.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020069.JPG)

Put the o-ring in a corresponding groove in the wheel cap.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020072.JPG)
