# Prepare: Check if you have everything

Here you have part-count lists which you can use to check if everything needed to assemble the Rover is on table.

If something is missing, feel free to [contact us](mailto:%20contact@turtlerover.com). Most of the time, we'll just ship it and won't ask who's fault is it.
