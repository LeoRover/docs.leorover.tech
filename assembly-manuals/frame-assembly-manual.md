# Task 3: Frame and suspension assembly

## Intro

### Assembly time

30 minutes

### Tools needed

* [ ] T10 torx screwdriver \(provided\)
* [ ] wide flat screwdriver
* [ ] no. 3 hex-head key \(metric; provided\)
* [ ] no. 5 hex-head key \(metric; provided\)
* [ ] hex-head wrench no. 7
* [ ] hex-head wrench no. 10

## Assembly manual

### Step 1: Main axis bearing holder

Prepare:

* [ ] 8x m4x20 inner hex-headed screw
* [ ] 8x m4 nut
* [ ] frame
* [ ] 2x aluminum bearing holder
* [ ] hex-head key no. 3
* [ ] hex-head wrench no. 7

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020113.jpeg)

Put the bearing holder in a corresponding cutout in frame side. Align the holes.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020114.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020116.jpeg)

Push 4x m4x20 screws in the holes. 

{% hint style="info" %}
It's easier to push all the screws first, and only then secure the nuts. Sometimes the screws jam due to paint coming in the holes and it's easier to align when the connection is still loose.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020118.jpeg)

Tighten 4x m4 nuts to the screws using both no. 3 key and no. 7 wrench.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020121.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020124.jpeg)

Do the same on the opposite side of the frame.

### Step 2: Differential bar holder

Prepare:

* [ ] step 1 assembly
* [ ] differential bar holder
* [ ] 3x m4x10 torx screw
* [ ] 3x m4 nut
* [ ] T10 screwdriver
* [ ] flat wrench no. 7

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020172.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020175.jpeg)

Connect differential bar holder to the frame using 3x m4x10 torx screws and m4 nuts. Make sure the screw heads are located from the internal side of the frame.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020179.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020183.jpeg)

### Step 3: Differential bar

Prepare:

* [ ] differential bar
* [ ] 2x plastic plain bearings with flanges
* [ ] 1x black axis screw
* [ ] 1x fi8 flat washer
* [ ] 1x m6 nut
* [ ] wide flat screwdriver
* [ ] flat wrench no. 10

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020184.jpeg)

Push the plastic bearings into the differential bar hole. One bearing on each side.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020188.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020189.jpeg)

Make sure the bearings flanges are flat on the bar.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020192.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020193.jpeg)

Put the black axis screw into differential bar holder. It may need to be pushed.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020196.jpeg)

Make sure the screw head touches the holder surface. If not, you may need to buff the holder hole edge.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020198.jpeg)

Pressing the screw with your finger, rotate the whole assembly to access the screw thread.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020200.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020202.jpeg)

Put one fi8 washer on the thread.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020204.jpeg)

Tighten a m6 nut with flat screwdriver \(screw head\) and no. 10 wrench. Make sure the washer stays concentric.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Tighten the bolt just enough to keep the parts together, but still able to rotate with a slight resistance.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020210.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020214.jpeg)

### Step 4: Suspension beam

Prepare:

* [ ] 2x suspension beam
* [ ] 2x ball-joint plastic pushrod
* [ ] 2x m6x16 round-head screw
* [ ] 2x m6 nut
* [ ] hex-head key no. 5
* [ ] hex wrench no. 10

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020216.jpeg)

Insert a m6x16 screw into pushrod ball-joint hole and then into differential arm hole. Mind the screw head position as shown in the photo.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020217.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020220.jpeg)

Put a m6 nut on the screw and tighten using no. 5 key and no. 10 wrench. Tighten just enough not to allow for any play between screw and ball-joint, but keep the joint rotating.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020221.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020223.jpeg)

Do it twice - for the opposite suspension beam as well.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020226.jpeg)

### Step 5: Suspension to frame assembly

Prepare:

* [ ] step 3 assembly
* [ ] step 4 assemblies
* [ ] 2x main axis screw \(m6 with smooth surface\)
* [ ] 2x m6 nut
* [ ] 6x fi8 washer \(2x additional in case of loose suspension issue\)
* [ ] 4x ball bearing
* [ ] hex-head key no. 5
* [ ] hex wrench no. 10

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020228.jpeg)

A tricky part. You need to position on washer in the internal side of the suspension beam to act as a main axis washer \(central hole\).

To do it put the washer from one side into the beam. Then put something \(finger, screwdriver, etc.\) into the bigger central hole and tilt the beam to make the washer slide all the way to stop in the central area. Then roll the beam to make the washer jump to the perpendicular wall. See the photos.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020231.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020236.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020238.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020244.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020248.jpeg)

Using a no. 5 key slip a main axis screw through the beam bigger hole, thread the washer at the same time and slip the screw all the way through the smaller hole. You'll end up having a screw protruding from the other side with a washer between the screw head and beam wall.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020250.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020252.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020258.jpeg)

Remember to keep the no. 5 key holding the axis all the time during the next steps.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020262.jpeg)

Slide another fi8 washer on the axis and then slide one ball bearing on that.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020272.jpeg)

Now prepare the Rover frame with differential beam assembly. Slide the suspension beam with axis and bearing in the frame axis holder \(side of the frame\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020273.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020279.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020281.jpeg)

Put another ball bearing from the opposite side of the holder.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020283.jpeg)

Put one fi8 washer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020292.jpeg)

And put m6 nut on the axis thread.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020294.jpeg)

Tighten the axis using no. 5 key \(as you used it to hold the axis assembly\) and no. 10 wrench.

Remember to keep the fi8 washer concentric when tightening as it tends to jam between the axis screw edge and nut, which may occur as loose suspension issue.

Tighten the assembly just enough to keep it with no play, but with no issues in the joint operation.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the suspension is still loose even after you tighten the joint, you may need to add another fi8 washer behind the axis nut.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020298.jpeg)

Do it again with the opposite side axis.

### Step 6: Differential to suspension connection

Prepare:

* [ ] step 5 assembly
* [ ] 2x m6x16 rounded-head screw
* [ ] no. 5 hex key

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020301.jpeg)

Tilt the suspension differential pushrod to meed the differential bar surface.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020303.jpeg)

Insert a m6x16 screw in the pushrod ball-joint to meet differential bar thread.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020306.jpeg)

Tighten the connection with a no. 5 key. Tighten just enough to keep it together with no play, but possible for the joint to operate. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020307.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020309.jpeg)

Do the same on the opposite side.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020311.jpeg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020313.jpeg)

### Step 7: Backframe

Prepare:

* [ ] step 6 assembly
* [ ] backframe
* [ ] 4x m4x8 torx screws
* [ ] T10 torx screwdriver

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020354.jpg)

Put the backframe to meet the frame mounting holes: 2x m4 holes on the top side and 2x m4 holes on the bottom.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020358.jpg)

Insert 2x m4x8 torx screws on the top and tighten them using T10 torx screwdriver.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020359.jpg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020363.jpg)

Roll the whole assembly to access the bottom.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020365.jpg)

Put 2x m4x8 torx screws into corresponding holes of the backframe. Position the backframe to stay symmetric to the frame \(holes are bigger to allow the setting\) and tighten the screws with a T10 torx screwdriver.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020367.jpg)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1020369.jpg)

### Done!

## Troubleshooting

### Loose suspension

It may happen that after the assembly your Rover suspension is wobbly and loose. Check if the main axis nut is properly tightened. If the connection is tight and the issue occurs, please unscrew the nut, add an extra spacer between the nut and the bearing and then tighten the joint.
