Push the nut through barrel plug.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It comes off tight - don't worry, you won't break it.
{% endhint %}

![It&apos;s tough to push the nut through the plug, but it&apos;s doable - don&apos;t worry.](../.gitbook/assets/p1010736_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010737_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

Route barrel plug and then green cable through a corresponding cutout in main electronics box wall.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010739_wynik.JPG)

Push the socket in place. Mind how the socket is positioned - white dot.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010741_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

Thread the socket nut back through the barrel plug and green cable. Tighten the nut \(tightening by hand is enough\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure the socket o-ring \(red\) is positioned properly. Evenly at the external side of the box wall.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010742_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

Disassemble miniUSB socket nut.

### Step 4: Antenna cable

Prepare:

* [ ] step 3 assembly
* [ ] antenna cable with o-ring, nut and toothed washer \(put o-ring on the socket if needed\)
* [ ] vaseline
* [ ] flat wrench no. 8

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't use spring washer that may be provided with the antenna cable. Use the toothed one.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010755_wynik.JPG)

Put some vaseline on the socket o-ring.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010760_wynik%20%282%29.JPG)

Place the socket in a dedicated cutout in MEB floor. Rotate it to meet the cutout shape. Don't push it - we'll do it by tightening the socket nut.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010759_wynik.JPG)

Put the toothed washer and socket nut on the opposite side \(external wall\) and tighten it using no. 8 wrench. Make sure the socket pulls equally in the cutout \(looking from internal side\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010762_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

* [ ] zip-ties

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010776_wynik.JPG)

Put some vaseline on the cable ends.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't detach heat-shrinks located at the cables ends - they are used to easily route the cables. Otherwise you'll have 6 wires to route in every step.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010778_wynik.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010779_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

Push the wire through rubber bushing from inside to outside of the main electronics box.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010782_wynik.JPG)

Pull the wire keeping the end of black isolation still inside the box.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010784_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

Do the same with the rest of wires.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010786_wynik.JPG)

Secure the ends of black isolation with zip-ties. This way the cable won't be pulled out during the rest of assembly process.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010788_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010790_wynik.JPG)

{% hint style="warning" %}
RaspberryPi USB ports need to face microUSB socket in MEB. As in the photo below.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010805_wynik.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010811_wynik.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010812_wynik.JPG)

Prepare the white camera tape. Connect it to RaspberryPi port named 'camera'. Make sure there's a connection between the tape and the port pins.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010815_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010816_wynik%20%281%29.JPG)

Connect the tape to camera port. Route the tape so it won't come in a way when mounting next components.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use a little screwdriver to press and pull the camera tape securing element as there's only little space and you won't be able to move the element by hand.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010818_wynik.JPG)

Take USB-A plug and twist it to connect to the nearest RaspberryPi USB port.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010821_wynik.JPG)

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you turn the board power switch to ON.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010842_wynik.JPG)

MEB has each of the wheel cables named by the place where it's routed through external wall.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010845_wynik.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010846_wynik.JPG)

Connect the wheel cables to corresponding hMotor ports of Core2-ROS. Make sure you connect right 'letters' to the right ports. As well the 6-ping sockets should be positioned the way white cables mate with EncB and red cables with MotA labels of motor ports.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010848_wynik.JPG)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you don't have any cable routed above power section of the board. Route it either under the board or any other way.

This section causes serious interference to encoder signal and the Rover wheels may behave strangely when cables touch the electronics components.
