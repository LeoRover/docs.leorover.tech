# Main Electronics Box assembly

There's not enough photos here, but we're working on it. Here are some bullet points though:

1. Unpack a front camera shield \(glass\) provided and assemble it to the front of MEB.
2. Use short cross-headed screwdriver or simply put your screwdriver through a rear hole to have enough space to tighten the 4x shield screws.
3. Unpack a camera provided and disconnect its tape \(comes connected to the camera\).
4. Assemble the camera using 2x 2,2x6,5 self-tapping screws provided \(use short screwdriver or do the same as in 2.\).
5. Unpack an antenna connector and miniUSB sealed connector and guide them through the mating holes in MEB floor \(or ceiling, depends on the perspective\). Secure them in place.
6. Unpack and secure rear power connector \(3pin with green cable\).
7. Open Core2ROS box \(the one colored white-red as true Polish patriotic product\) and unscrew it from the plastic stand. Unscrew the free distances as well.
8. Open RaspberryPi box \(you'll know which one\) and tighten the distances to the Pi.
9. Unpack Wifi USB modem from a separate bag and use 4x plastic m2,5x18 distances to attach RaspberryPi to Core2ROS hat.
10. Use 2x self-tapping screws to attach the modem to its 3d-printed \(00183\) mounting adapter \(modem lays on the flat side\).
11. Assemble the modem together with the adapter
