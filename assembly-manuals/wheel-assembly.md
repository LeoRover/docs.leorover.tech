## Prepare aluminum tubes \(part no. 00008\)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you received the aluminum tubes with plastic motor mounts already attached - continue to the next point.
{% endhint %}

If you 3d-printed plastic parts on your own, you'll need to glue the plastic motor mounts to the tubes using any resin-based glue \(do not use cyanoacrylate glues - the 5 minute ones etc., because they tend not to stick to the plastic\).

## Ball bearings and sealing

{% hint style="info" %}
Your kit may include 2x metal-covered bearings \(no rubber-sealed bearing - black\) - don't worry then, we're just experimenting with different types of bearings and all of them are just fine.

The same with rubber sealings - they may be different colour, don't worry as well.
{% endhint %}
