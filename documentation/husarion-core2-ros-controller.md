# Husarion CORE2-ROS controller

Leo Rover is based on CORE2-ROS electronics board which, together with RoaspberryPi 3B+, controlls all the Rover functionalities.

We encourage you to check all the specs of the board itself as there's a great amount of intrfaces to be used for further development.

## Ports used in Leo Rover

To make it easier, we listed all the interfaces used by the Rover as default. Just to make sure you don't interfere with them when developing.

## Additional warning

{% hint style="warning" %}
Take into consideration during the Rover assembly and development.

The board corner where there's power connector and power-related components tends to interfere with sensitive electronics such as wheel encoders. Make sure the encoder cables don't run on top of the corner.
