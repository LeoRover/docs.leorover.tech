### **How to connect to the Rover?**

To connect to the Rover, turn Leo on using its main power button located on the left side of the battery. The button will be lighted green when turned on.

After ca. 60 s the Rover system should begin to work, check your controller device for WiFi network:

Name: LeoRover[+serial number]
Password: password
```
