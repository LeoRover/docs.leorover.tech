# Waterproof USB Camera

A little IP66 USB camera that we use in our robots. Originally we use 180-degree fisheye 2MPx camera, but you can mount anything you like.

Here we prepared a graphic description how to assemble your own camera using either our kit or parts that you source based on a BOM provided. Have fun!

{% hint style="info" %}
Disclaimer: the camera is not a plug&play solution for Leo Rover. You still need to treat it as a typical USB camera \(install drivers and stuff\).

## Gather all the components

## Prepare the USB cable and the camera cover

You need to puncture the rubber bushing with a screwdriver before you put the cable through it.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010373.JPG)

Cut the excess 5th cable - it's normally used as USB shield, but we don't need it.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010375.JPG)

Cut 4 pieces of cable sleeve or just use a isolating tape to isolate the wires after soldering. Solder the matching pairs and cover them.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010377.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010386.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010387.JPG)

Put a ziptie close to the end of black isolation so it won't be able to pull the cable back through the rubber bushing.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010390.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010392.JPG)

Pull the cable until it touches the bushing.

## Prepare the camera shield

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010397.JPG)

Make sure you put the seal in the right direction.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010399.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010401.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010404.JPG)

Use the little Torx screws provided with the Lens Shield Replacement Kit.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010408.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010413.JPG)

Make sure the seal is evenly squeezed. If not, tighten the corresponding screw.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010416.JPG)

## Assemble the camera board

Before you do the next step, cut the outer frame of the camera with any hand cutter you have. Just do it with caution as you won't get any second chance!

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010420.JPG)

Make sure the camera is put in the right direction.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010425.JPG)

Use 4x 2.2x6.5 self-tapping screws.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010427.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010430.JPG)

## Put the cover seal in its groove

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010434.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010435.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010438.JPG)

After you complete the seal setting, cut the excess and leave extra 2-3 mm for the seal to overlap.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010441.JPG)

This way the parts will seal themselves when pressed by mounting screws.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010442.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010445.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010449.JPG)

Use 2x 2.9x9.5 self-tapping screws at first to make sure the seal is properly set, then secure the next ones.

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010452.JPG)

![](../.gitbook/assets/p1010453.JPG)

## Done!

The front holes act as a mounting points. You can use the 2.9x9.5 self-tapping screws to mount the camera to anything you need.
